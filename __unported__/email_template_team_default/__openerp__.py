When a a new message is created, from the "Communication & History" tab, a blank message is displayed.
This module allows the definition of an e-mail template to use as default, so you can include company stationery
and even personalize with data from commonly used fields.
Definitions are made at: CRM -> Configuration -> Sales -> Sales Teams.

Known issues:
- It will only work correctly for the model for which the e-mail template was created.
