Reference sequences for Issues, configurable by Category.
For example: an IT Management related issue might have a "IT-xxxxx" sequence, and a Building maintenance issue an independent "B-xxxx" sequence.
If no specific Sequence is specified, the default "Project Issue" sequence will be used.
If the crm_categ_hierarchy module is also installed, specific sequences will apply to all child categories.
