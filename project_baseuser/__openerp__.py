    'name': 'Projects extensions for user roles',
    'version': '1.0',
    'category': 'Project Management',
    'summary': 'Extend Project user roles to support more complex use cases',
    'description': """\
Employees are now basic Project users, able to create new documents (Issues
or Tasks). These are kept editable while in New and Cancelled states, to
allow for corrections or for the user himself to cancel an incorretly
created request.
Previously, Employee users did not have any write nor craete access to project
documents.

Project Users, on the other hand, are supposed to act on these documents,
sucha as reported issues, and update them accordingly, so they have write
access for all states. Employee users don't have write access on later states,
but can still write comments and communicate through the message board (open
chatter).

In general, users will only be able to see documents where:

  * They are assigned/responsible for, or
  * They are following, or
  * They are a team member for the corresponding Project (but not if only in
    the project's follower list).


Project Managers have access rules similar to Project Users, but additionally
can create new projects and can see all documents for the projects they are
the Manager.
As a consequence, Project Managers no longer have inconditional access to all
Tasks and Issues, and will only be able to edit the definitions of Projects
they manage.

This makes it possible for a Project Manager to have private projects that
other users, Project Managers inlcuded, will not be able to see. They will
need to be added as followers or team members to able to see it.

Public Projects and their documents are still visible to everyone.
Portal users access rules are kept unchanged.
